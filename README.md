# ML_Microvasculature
Code1-Time_Averaged_Volume_Flow_Rate: In this code time-averaged volume flow rate can be obtained: A input and output data are read and an ANN model is generated on the given dataset therefore it can be used for the prediction of any other microvasculature 

Code2-Time-Avaraged_Hematocirt: Time-averaged hematocrit is calculated. ANN models are built for the prediction of cell motion through the microvascular network and finally, N number of cells are released at the entrance of the biggest artery these models are used to predict flux of RBC at each bifurcation and finnaly time-averaged hematocrit can be estimated throughout the vasculature.

Code3-Time_Dependent_Prediction: Here,time series can be predicted using the time windows approach. 

Code4-Prediction of simultaneous spatial and temporal variations: Spatially and temporally hematocrit and volume flow rate are evaluated in this code. Here we first predict the time variation of quantities such as volume flow rate and hematocrit in the mother vessel using methods described in Code3 and then models are generated for the prediction of volume flow rate and hematocrit from the mother vessel.
