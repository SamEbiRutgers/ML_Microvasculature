# ML_Microvasculature
Code1-Time_Averaged_Volume_Flow_Rate: in this code time-averaged volume flow rate can be obtained 

Code2-Time-Avaraged_Hematocirt: Time-averged hematcorit is calculated 

Code3-Time_Dependent_Prediction : We show how you predicte a time-series using different time windows

Code4-Prediction of simultaneous spatial and temporal variations:spatially and temporally hematocrit and volume flow rate is evaluated in this code
